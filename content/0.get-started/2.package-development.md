Welcome to the package development guide for NOBEARS frontend packages. This documentation covers our standardized approach to developing, maintaining, and releasing frontend packages.

## Overview

At NOBEARS, we maintain several types of packages:

- **UI Components**: Design systems and reusable interface elements (`@nobears-front-end/nuxt-ui`)
- **Framework Integrations**: Modules for Nuxt, Statamic, etc. (`@nobears-front-end/nuxt-statamic`)
- **Utility Libraries**: Shared functions and tools

### What You'll Learn

This guide will walk you through:

- Creating new packages using our starter templates
- Following our code standards and naming conventions
- Managing package versions and releases
- Writing and maintaining documentation
- Ensuring code quality through testing

Whether you're building a new package or maintaining an existing one, this guide ensures you follow our best practices and workflows.

## Package Types

Before we get started, let's take a look at the different types of packages we maintain.

1. **Layers**<br>
   Layers are specificly used in Nuxt projects, they are used to add extendable and **overrideable** code to your project. `@nobears-front-end/nuxt-ui` is a great example of this.
2. **Modules**<br>
   Modules are used to add framework or tool specific code to your project, e.g. `@nobears-front-end/nuxt-statamic` is a module for the Statamic CMS integration.
3. **Packages**<br>
   Packages are the simplest type of package, they are used to simple and extendable code that is not framework or tool specific. A ESlint config is a great example of this.
4. **Templates**<br>
   In order to keep it easy for developers to get started, we have created a set of starter templates.
   We have templates for starting a new package, a new project and more.

## Creating a new package

Before you start creating a new package, you should first check with other developers if the package is not already created or if it's not already in the process of being created. If you can't find a package that fits your needs, you can create a new one _(if you have permission to do so of course)_.

We use a [Jira board](https://nobears.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/FE/boards/467) to keep track of all the packages we maintain, if you need to create a new package, please create a new ticket in Jira in order to get the process started. From there you should start by describing the package you want to create, what it will be used for and what it will contain.

Once you have the green light from the team, you can start by creating a new package.

### Naming Convention
- Format: `@nobears-front-end/<tech-stack>-<package-name>`
- Examples:
  - `@nobears-front-end/nuxt-ui`
  - `@nobears-front-end/nuxt-statamic`
  - `@nobears-front-end/statamic-template`
  
If we take a look at the `nuxt-statamic` package, you'll notice that it has 2 frameworks/ tech stacks in the name.
This is because it's a package that is used to integrate Statamic with Nuxt, in these cases it's best to use the naming convention `<tech-stack-of-the-project>-<tool-or-integration-name>`.

### Versioning
- Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/)
- Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- Beta releases: `1.0.0-beta.1`

::tip
When using one of our starter templates, the versioning will be handled automatically by the release-it configuration.
::

### Required Files
- `package.json`: Package configuration
- `README.md`: Package documentation
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Version history
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration
- `types/`: TypeScript types _(we prefer to use `.d.ts`{lang="sh"} files instead of regular `.ts`{lang="sh"} files)_
- `test/`: Test files _(if applicable)_
- `docs/`: Documentation


### Documentation

::tip{to="https://git.nobears.nl/nobears-front-end/templates/nuxt-module-starter"}
In our module starter template, we have a pre-configured documentation setup.
::

Adding documentation to your package is done by adding a `docs` folder to the root of your package.

This folder will be read by our frontend doc, thus automatically adding your package to the general documentation site.

- Place documentation in `docs/` directory
- Include:
  - Getting started guide
  - API reference
  - Examples

## Releasing a package

We follow a structured release process to ensure quality and stability across both beta and stable releases.
Specifically, we use [release-it](https://github.com/release-it/release-it) to release new versions of our packages.

It is a **requirement** that you update the `CHANGELOG.md` file before releasing a new version of a package. If you skip this step, we have no way of knowing what has changed in the package and we can't create a proper changelog for when we need a specific version of a package.

::tip{to="https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/"}
Please follow the [Changelog Guidelines](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) when updating the `CHANGELOG.md` file.
::

### Beta Releases
1. Create feature branch from `preview`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` - [Changelog Guidelines](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
3. Submit PR for review
4. Merge to `preview`
5. Run `pnpm release-beta`

### Stable Releases
1. Create branch from `main` or merge `preview`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md` - [Changelog Guidelines](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
3. Submit PR for review
4. Merge to `main`
5. Run `pnpm release`
